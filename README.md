# LightVulnScanner
This is a repository for a lightweight vulnerability scanner written in Python. Itâ€™s designed 
to help people practice scanning for open ports and checking for known vulnerabilities using 
searchsploit. The goal is to make a simple tool for educational use on systems you have permission to test.
